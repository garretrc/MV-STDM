## 01_data_processing

Data processing script to obtain the multivariate spatiotemporal field matrices for each pathway. Also provides codes for spatial plots and indices for the space and time locations of each holdout set scenario. Scenario 1, or s1, is the spatial block holdout, and Scenario 2, or s2, is the random location holdout.

## 02_simulation

This file contains the data generation, MCMC, and figures for the simulated data example.

## 03, 04, 05_mcmc...

These files contain the code to run the DLM sampler, contained in spatial_stats/dlm_code, and produce the results for the full data and both s1 and s2. Results are saved in cee drive, cldera/obs_thrust/dm_results.

## 06, 07, 08 plots

These files contain the figures for the results sections and a few additional explorations of the posterior samples.
